# BandStructure_DOS_PDOS
BSb 2D Structure: Band Structure, DOS, and PDOS Plots
This repository contains all the files and scripts used to generate the band structure, density of states (DOS), and projected density of states (PDOS) for the BSb 2D material using Xmgrace.

Included Files:
Input and output files for band structure and DOS/PDOS plots
Scripts to process and visualize data in Xmgrace
Example plots showing how to combine band structure and DOS/PDOS into a single image
Instructions for replicating the results
How to Use:
Clone the repository or download the files.
Follow the instructions in the README.md to install dependencies and run the scripts.
You can modify the input files to plot data for your own materials.
